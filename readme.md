# Euchre500

## A web application designed to allow Euchre groups to keep track of their Euchre stats over a period of time while introducing another competitive aspect: a race to hit an overall score of 500 points!

How to play:

1. Create a new Euchre500 circuit
2. Assign players to the new circuit (select 'Add Player' to add to the player list) 
3. After each round played, input the round results for each team/player matchup
4. Click submit to push the current round scores to the Circuit totals
